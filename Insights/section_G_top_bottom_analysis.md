<b> Q25. Identify the top 3 performing customers based on total purchases. </b>                                                   
### <i> Explanation </i> 
This question aims to identify the top-performing customers based on total spending. To solve it, 
I used a subquery in the FROM clause to first calculate the total amount spent by each customer and assign a rank based on the sum in descending order. 
Then, in the outer query, I filtered for ranking <= 3 to retrieve only the top three customers.

### <i> Query: </i>

    -- Main Query
    SELECT 
    		*
    FROM
    	(-- subquery to get rank the customers
    	SELECT 
    			user_id,
    			SUM(total_amount) AS total_purchase,
    			RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(total_amount) DESC) AS ranking
    	FROM orders
    	GROUP BY user_id) AS r
    WHERE r.ranking <=3;

### <i> Insight: </i>
1. customers with ID - 6, 1, 3 were the top perfroming customers.
2. These top 3 customers represent a substantial portion of total sales. They contributed 56% of the total revenue generated by the mart.
3. We can consider offering incentives or exclusive deals to these top customers to retain them.
