<p align="center">A retail mart SQL project exploring customer behavior, sales trends, and supplier performance</p>

### OVERVIEW -                                                                                   
The Cal_Mart database was designed to simulate how a modern retail mart operates and manages its daily transactions through data. It contains five main tables: Users, Products, Orders, Suppliers, and Savings. All connected to track customer behavior, product performance, and financial activities.

### TABLE BREAKDOWN -                                                                                                                                                                             
- Users: Contains customer details such as name, contact info, and join date.
- Products: Holds information about all items available in the mart including price, category, and supplier.
- Suppliers: Stores details of the vendors that supply products to the mart.
- Orders: Records all customer purchase activities including quantity, order date, and total amount.
- Savings: Tracks each customer’s wallet balance and reward points earned after purchases. This helps to measure loyalty and spending patterns.

### PROJECT GOAL -                                                                                                                                                                             
This project was created to practice and demonstrate key SQL concepts while answering real-world business questions. It builds on the previous DrayCoe_Mart project but introduces more advanced analysis and query techniques.
